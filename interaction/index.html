	<p> For this task, we first looked at nonsense websites, many of which involved user interaction. Our next step was to create such a website ourselves.</p>

	<p>However, one must not forget: even if it’s a nonsense website, the interaction still needs to make some sense and provide some kind of value to a broader audience. Ideally, the interaction has a goal that the user wants to achieve. The biggest challenge in this task was coming up with ideas and developing a concept.</p>
		
	<p>I came up with three ideas: "Make It Rain", "Müll aufsammeln" and "Dreiecksraster". The first two are strongly inspired by already existing nonsense websites. I think the principle of my third idea (the triangle grid) is more interesting and original than the other two: using buttons on the sides of the grid, the rows and columns can be shifted to create a custom design. If you like the displayed grid, another button can be clicked to take a screenshot and save it to the desktop.
