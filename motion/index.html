	<p> This task was about representing different types of movement.

		Here, we used VS Code for the first time to program, which was already the first challenge. Up to this point, we had only used CodePen, so I first had to learn the basics of VS Code: setting up project folders on the desktop, how the file explorer and libraries work, and how to preview the code. One important lesson here was to maintain good organization on the computer to avoid confusion and always find files quickly.
		
		The next challenge was: how do I represent movement without neglecting the “keep it simple” principle learned from the Perspectives project?
		
		For the “through” movement, this was difficult. I solved it by letting the ball move in front of a semicircle but behind the second half of the circle.
		
		Another tricky concept was “turn around”: how do I represent movement around its own axis, and how do I make it visible?
		
		This concept already suggests the need for a three-dimensional object, so I learned how to use WEBGL and how it affects the coordinate system of the sketch. To make the movement more visible, I placed an additional object on the rotating ball. Another possible approach would have been to work with a light cone.
		
		Additionally, I learned how to use the Ease function, as it makes movement more natural and smooth.
		
		One last challenge was uploading the sketches to my archive website via GitHub, as the process involved many steps and I had never done it before.
