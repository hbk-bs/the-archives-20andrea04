	<p> In our last project, we explored physical computing using the Arduino board.</p>

	<p>First, I learned what the Arduino board is and how many different projects can be created with it.</p>
	
	<p>Our entire class worked on a group project where we built small LED and sensor-based projects using the board.
		
		The first challenge was finding a common theme that everyone was happy with since each small group had a different idea. However, this improved our teamwork and ability to compromise.</p>
		
		<p>Next, I learned about the many different sensors we could use. The large selection made it difficult to decide on one, but Anna and I chose the motion sensor for our project. However, I understand the criticism that another sensor—one that reacts to touch, for example—might have been more fitting. The wire-built tree visually invites touch, so it would have been interesting if it responded to touch instead of movement.</p>
		
		<p>For me, the hardest part of this project was understanding circuits. I had very little prior knowledge, so it was difficult for me to figure out where each wire needed to go, especially since many components were involved: the Arduino board, LEDs, power supply, and the sensor. However, a sketch by Fabian helped us understand the circuit.
		
		Soldering was also difficult for me, but I’m sure practice makes perfect in this skill.</p>
		
		<p>Despite the challenges, this was my favorite project. The most exciting part was stepping away a little from theory and working hands-on, which I believe suits me better.</p>
