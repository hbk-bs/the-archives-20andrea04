	<p> In this task, we had to write an algorithm and have different people execute it. In my algorithm, a wreath of seven circles in the seven colors of the rainbow was to be drawn. In both attempts, I had to rewrite my original algorithm twice to achieve the desired result.</p>

		<p>What I learned from this task is that instructions must be very precise and formulated in a way that is objectively understandable for everyone.
		
		These insights could later be transferred to programming. The task of the analog algorithm illustrated this principle well and simply.</p>
