	<p> In this project, we used small p5.js sketches to represent perspective.

	This was the first project in which I really started programming, meaning it was my introduction to the world of JavaScript. Here, I learned how to create a canvas, draw shapes, place them and more.</p>
		
	<p>Besides learning the basics of generative design with p5.js, I also learned which visual elements can be used to create perspective and depth in a two-dimensional space. Examples include overlapping, diminishing size in the background, blurring etc. </p>
		
	<p>One last lesson from this project was that design should remain simple! Often, just a few simple shapes are enough to convey the message or clarify the intention.</p>
